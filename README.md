# mdtools: Tools for Running MD Simulations in OpenMM

This repo will hold useful scripts and libraries for running MD simulations
in OpenMM. For now, mdtools will hold an assortment of scripts/tools, but it will
be reorganized once I better define my workflow and common use cases.

For this reason, please be wary that the organization of this repo and behavior of
code will likely change.

# Installation

It is recommended to use the Anaconda distribution for Python 3.6. These
scripts and libraries will make use of the following packages:
* OpenMM
* MDTraj

# Examples

Example scripts that make use of the provided libraries will be found in the
examples directory (Stay tuned).
